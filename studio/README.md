# Supabase Studio

A dashboard for managing your self-hosted Supabase project, and used on our [hosted platform](https://app.supabase.com). Built with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Supabase UI](https://ui.supabase.com/)
- [MobX](https://www.mobxjs.com/)

## Disclaimer

Supabase Studio is under heavy development. Apologies for any confusing patterns used while we're refactoring the codebase. If you're planning to contribute, it is advised that you run `git pull` frequently to retrieve the latest updates.

## What's included

Studio is designed to work with existing deployments - either the local hosted, docker setup, or our CLI. It is not intended for managing the deployment and administration of projects - that's out of scope.

As such, the features exposed on Studio for existing deployments are limited to those which manage your database:

- Table & SQL editors
  - Saved queries are unavailable
- Database management
  - Policies, roles, extensions, replication
- API documentation

## Managing Project Settings

Project settings are managed outside of the Dashboard. If you use docker-compose, you should manage the settings in your docker-compose file. If you're deploying Supabase to your own cloud, you should store your secrets and env vars in a vault or secrets manager.

## How to contribute?

- Branch from `master` and name your branches with the following structure
  - `{type}/{branch_name}`
    - Type: `chore | fix | feature`
    - Branch Name: Arbitrary, just make sure it summarizes the work
- Send a PR to `master` and tag the following members in your PR as reviewers

### Developer Quickstart

1. install a supabase CLI;

```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

2. install docker;
3. start docker;
4. supabase init
5. supabase start
6. update envs; file: .env

```
  STUDIO_PG_META_URL=${API URL}/pg
  SUPABASE_REST_URL=${API URL}/rest/v1/
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=anon key
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=service_role key
```

also update `SUPABASE_URL` - use `API URL` but without `http://` part, for example:

```
  SUPABASE_URL=localhost:54321
```

7. install dependencies

```bash
  npm i
```

8. start dev server

```
  npm run dev
```

url: localhost:8082/admin

### Enable Storage and platform features

To enable Storage page (and platform other features) please add these variables to the `.env` file:

```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_PLATFORM=true
  READ_ONLY_URL=${API URL}/pg
  READ_ONLY_API_KEY=service_role key
```

To make Storage work locally please change `https` to `http` in [`StorageExplorerStore.js`](/studio/localStores/storageExplorer/StorageExplorerStore.js#L100) file in `initializeSupabaseClient` method:

```
  ...
  this.supabaseClient = createClient(`http://${serviceEndpoint}`, serviceKey, {
  ...
```

## Running within a self-hosted environment

Firstly, follow the guide [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/docker) to get started with self-hosted Supabase.

```
cd ..
cd docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f ./dev/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Once you've got that set up, update `.env` in the studio folder with the corresponding values.

```
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=
```

Then run the following commands to install dependencies and start the dashboard.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## UI Testing Notes

### `<Popover>` vs `<Dropdown>`

When simulating clicks on these components, do the following:

```js
// for Popovers
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
userEvent.click('Hello world')

// for Dropdowns
import clickDropdown from 'tests/helpers'
clickDropdown('Hello world')
```
